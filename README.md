# DGL 409 Wuikinuxv Learning App
 Web App for DGL 409 that helps users learn Wuikinuxv language

## Setup
Using Vite, I initially set up this app using `npm create vite@latest` then, following initial setup prompts by Vite, ran `npm install` and then finally `npm run dev` to actually get the local dev environment running.
